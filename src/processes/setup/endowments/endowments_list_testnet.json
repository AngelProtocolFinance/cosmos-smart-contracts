We draw from ancient ideas and practices through modern inventions. No idea is off limits for discussion and debate in order to reach the ultimate goal of making and re-making a sustainable future.\n\n\n\nWorking from the idea that the development of solutions must take place in context, Rizoma Foundation seeks accelerate ethically-driven, grounded initiatives in order to facilitate meaningful long-term changes in thinking and behaviors for the world.
