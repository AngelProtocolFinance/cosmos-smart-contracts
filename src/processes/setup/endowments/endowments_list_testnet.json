We create marathon races that engage the runners directly with the projects on the frontlines of the Sustainable Development Goals. From Quality Education in Nepal, to Zero Hunger in Malawi, to Reduced Inequalities in Guatemala and Life on Land in Scotland. In each country, our races act as a conduit to new partnerships between public, private and third sector to catalyse their goals through our platform. In 6 years, we have raised over $1.2m for over 20 grassroots organisations through Impact Runner Fundraising. Each organisation then has the opportunity to directly engage with those fundraisers and that can mean direct implementation of the funds, the creation of story-telling content and connecting with new corporate partners. We focus all our efforts on being the grant-makers that charities dream of. Supportive, pro-active and unrestricted. We have built the platform through our races, how can they unleash the power of running to achieve their goals?\"}]}",
