# LOCALTERRA SAMPLE WASMS

## TERRASWAP
This folder contains example TerrSwap wasms for all contracts needed in running the test suite on LocalTerra. Contract wasms were built from TerraSwap GitHub Repo [https://github.com/terraswap/terraswap] commit #97cefa3

## ASTROPORT-LBP
This folder contains example Astroport LBP wasms for all contracts needed in running the Astroport Frontend or the Angel Protocol web app's LBP page on LocalTerra. These contract wasms were built off of an Angel Protocol forked repo [https://github.com/AngelProtocolFinance/astroport-lbport] of Astroport's GitHub Repo [https://github.com/astroport-fi/astroport-lbport], `astro-base-2percent`. This branch modifies the static `commission_rate` on the Pair contract to 2%.
